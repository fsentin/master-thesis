This thesis explores the explainability of using EEG brain recordings to distinguish between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with depression. To identify patterns and predictive biomarkers, a variety of analytical approaches were used, including exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, explainable AI-based feature rankings, and feature subset evaluation. Challenges arose from the dataset’s size, the high feature-to-instance ratio, and the dependability of methods on different assumptions and architectures, limiting their effectiveness and agreement. Notably, the analysis suggests differences in central tendencies and variances between the two groups, a non-linear relationship between EEG features and depression, and the potential biomarkers being the frontal brain area, left hemisphere, and beta waves when used in isolation, or pre-frontal, frontal, temporal, and parietal regions as well as alpha, delta, and gamma waves when used in combination. While definitive conclusions are constrained by dataset and method limitations, the insights gained lay the groundwork for future EEG-based studies aiming to refine depression diagnostics and treatment strategies.
